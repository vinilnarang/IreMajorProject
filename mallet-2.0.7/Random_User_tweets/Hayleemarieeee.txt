I may have failed but I have loved you from the start.
If two people are happy together.. You leave them the fuck alone.
because fuck you that's why
Sometime we need to think a little less, live a little more and make our lives a lot happier.
The best feeling in the world is when you realize you just don't care anymore
Sometimes we have to lose our way to find out what we really want, because we often ignore our needs until we are lost.
And even if all we'll ever be is just friends, I'll still take that.
If you can quote the whole "Step Brothers" movie then we'll get along just fine.
#IfWeDate always kiss me goodnight.
@sadeyedlady4 I love you! Feel better! :)
Your girlfriend should be your best friend. So stop treating her like just anybody.

@sadeyedlady4 I love youuuuuu!
The more respect you have for yourself the happier you will be, and the more you will realize that you always deserve the best.
Life is much easier when we're not putting our happiness based on our expectation on anything or anyone but God.
@JCo_Knows keep your head up! We all Love you!!
Who wants to go do something? I am so bored

The only thing you can be certain of improving is yourself.
You can't worry about people who aren't worried about you..
All I have to say is fuck you.
@Vivgabriela love you!
Why can't people get over the past and just be happy?
Hopefully hard work pays off. I'm so sick of this shit.
Everyday, I find myself finding more and more things that I don't like about you.
All you really need is to be surrounded by the ones who help you become a better person.
There are a lot of ways that you can start your day, but the most important way is with prayer.

Sometimes you need to lower your standards so that your expectations meet reality.
A great way to communicate sometimes is to just listen. It's more about what's right not who's right
Don't measure the progress of the relationship by time, evaluate it by the growth in areas like communication, comfort, happiness etc.
There are some thoughts you can't avoid and some feelings you can't deny.
You must forgive those who hurt you, if you don't forgive they have the power over you, forgiveness is for you and no one else.

Let go when you're hurting too much, give up when love isn't enough, and move on when things aren't like they were before.
I pray not because I need something, but because I’m ought to thank God about something.

You only have control over yourself and how you choose to be as a person. As for others, you can only choose to accept them or walk away.

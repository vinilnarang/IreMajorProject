GOP response “No, we shouldn’t go back to the way things were, but the President’s health care law is not working.” #nprSOTU
Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.) giving the GOP response: pic.twitter.com/2oYmHTdXDY
If you're watching the GOP response, Cathy McMorris Rodgers represents the Eastern Washington state seat once held by Speaker Tom Foley
Makes me wish I was at home kissing my kid goodnight. But snuck one in early, a noon “goodnight” kiss. #nprlife #nprSOTU

Wow, Cory Remsburg took all the snark out of my Twitter feed. Something else impressive!
Tenth deployment. Tenth. RT @LATSeema The reaction to Army Sgt Remsburg was awesome
No mention of Keystone XL in President Obama's SOTU. #nprSOTU http://www.npr.org/2014/01/28/267901424/transcript-obamas-state-of-the-union-address-as-prepared-for-delivery …
America must end "permanent war." Legacies of post-9/11 fight are Gitmo, drones, surveillance. Does a war on terror ever end? How? #nprsotu
Sr Admin Official doesn’t expect a big change in the polls to come out of this speech. Not enough people watching, for starters. #nprSOTU
POTUS: Our freedom, our democracy, has never been easy.  #sotu @wdet #nprSOTU
President renews call to close Gitmo. Calls on Congress to help. Half prisoners there are cleared for release but can't be let go. #nprsotu
It's just amazing that Sgt. Corey Remsburg is in good enough shape to be at the #SOTU. A credit to his grit and to modern medicine. #nprsotu
You're not imagining it: This speech is long for Obama. His previous SOTUs average 1 hour, 9 minutes. http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/files/2013/02/sotu.png …
Texas GOP delegation's vigorous tweeting throughout #SOTU offers a revealing glimpse at how deeply the base dislikes Obama
A laundry list, but sharply drawn: opening half hour was like a 2014 campaign agenda, themes Democrats would love to run on.
President Obama issues a veto threat for any new Iran sanctions bill. Many in congress want to send him one. #nprSOTU
POTUS says "this needs to be the year...we close the prison at Guantanamo Bay." A campaign promise in 2008. #nprSOTU
Obama: Terrorists want us to fight with "large-scale deployments that drain our strength and may ultimately feed extremism." #nprSOTU
A big IF: President says Afghanistan must sign security deal before U.S. will decide on keeping as many as 10,000 troops there. #nprsotu
I wondered if he would give a nod to LBJ's "War on Poverty" speech 50 years ago. Don't see it. #nprSOTU
"If" the Afghan government signs, a small force "could" remain: the full-on hedging the moment required.
Someone's happy pic.twitter.com/QFcnu8bRdf
GOP points out Dems have supported some of the bills to repeal/alter ACA, and POTUS has signed some. #true #nprSOTU
Another way to sidestep Congress: President threatens to veto any new sanctions bill on Iran. #nprsotu
“Kentucky’s not the most liberal part of the country” -- the president won just 4 of the state's 120 counties in 2012.
Did the president just tell me to offer my mom tech support? As if she needed any more encouragement. #SOTU
This is the ACA advertisement part of the speech. Big audience. Free media. "Call your mom." #nprSOTU
POTUS singles out everything popular about ACA without mentioning any of the problems #nprSOTU

Obama: "It’s not just oil and natural gas production that’s booming; we’re becoming a global leader in solar" #nprSOTU
As kidney transplant recipient,this resonates:#SOTU no one"can ever again be dropped/denied coverage for a preexisting condition." #nprSOTU
A curated selection of photos from tonight's #SOTU are up on http://npr.org 's homepage. Check 'em out! #NPRSOTU
POTUS : Nat gas is "bridge fuel" that can replace foreign oil, worthy of fed support ... may not please anti-fracking movement  #nprsotu
Is that the 5th auto industry comeback reference? #nprSOTU
"It's time." President Obama has called for comprehensive immigration reform in each of his past 4 SOTUs. #nprSOTU
Obama: "Every four minutes, another American home or business goes solar" #nprSOTU

Obama: "The debate is settled. Climate change is a fact." #SOTU #NPRsotu

Wonder if @BarackObama was trying to give @SenatorHagan a lift in a tough reelection by putting that high tech hub in NC? Hmmm.. #nprsotu
Trade is sticky for POTUS. GOP wants him to push harder for passage. Critics on the left call TPP NAFTA on steroids. #nprSOTU
Obama, crediting his "all-of-the-above energy strategy": "America is closer to energy independence than we’ve been in decades." #nprSOTU
America's "longest war will finally be over," President says, but still to be decided: whether 10,000 American troops stay behind. #nprsotu
.@BarackObama says he wants this to be a “year of action.” Last year congress only gave him 5% of what he asked for in his SOTU. #nprSOTU
After the speech and GOP rebuttals, there's a "state of the uterus" here: pic.twitter.com/pO8NnXQGom
Obama #SOTU tasks Biden to reform job skill training programs,connect employers&community colleges. Not a real springboard to 2016.#nprSOTU
Very odd. Some tv producers huddled around NPRs TV watching the address. (Guy seated is NPR's) #nprsotu pic.twitter.com/hKC9o0fuiy
Quote from speech pic.twitter.com/mbKPhYHzab
Key phrases like "middle class" and "ladders of opportunity" sound more like Jack Kemp than class warfare. #nprSOTU
Admin officials say this is NOT intended as a threat to congress, or to shame them to action. House GOP not convinced. #nprsotu
This year, @BarackObama says he is “eager” to work with congress. But will take executive action “wherever and whenever” he can. #nprSOTU
Oh, for a thought balloon above Speaker Boehner when @BarackObama took that shot at those who caused the government shutdown. #nprsotu
The speech will feature a total of 12 different executive actions the president plans to take over the coming weeks and months. #nprsotu
Obama opening sentences paint an America that's one part Norman Rockwell and one part Edward Hopper. #nprSOTU
Amazing this assertion has to be made: Obama #SOTU in prepared remarks says "Climate change is a fact." Watching for reaction. #nprSOTU
now that embargo is lifted, health section is about halfway through for those waiting...#nprSOTU
Do i have time to make popcorn before POTUS makes his way to the dais?

@coldplay "speed of sound" gives me a high no drug can match
Wow, we're getting 100s of responses to the question of your favourite Coldplay single. Read them all by clicking https://twitter.com/search/realtime?q=%40coldplay&src=typd … A
@coldplay @officialcharts hurts like heaven because its so energetic!!
@coldplay Very hard choice, but I think I'd have to say "Paradise". It's the kind of song a lot of people can relate to :)
@coldplay @officialcharts maybe fix you, cause when i listen this song its like my broken hope is fixed again...
@coldplay telling us to choose a favorite Coldplay single is like asking a parent who their favorite child is
In honour of the UK @officialcharts 60th birthday, we were wondering what your favourite Coldplay single is (and why)? A

Thanks for all the tweets about last night's #Live2012 cinema screening. Some wonderful tales of tears, joy and dancing in the aisles... A
@coldplay It helped me objectively understand what coldplay makes me feel. It was gorgeous and a great window into the life of the band.
@coldplay it was really beautiful! Thought the boys (+ and whole team on tour) came across sincere and thoughtful. Amazing music/show :)
So, who went to see #Live2012 in a cinema last night? What did you think? A
Tomorrow morning, those of you in Oz can watch the band perform in front of the Sydney Opera House on @Sunriseon7. A

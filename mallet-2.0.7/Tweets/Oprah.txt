"There is nothing more important than kindness" . @KarenAnchorite. Do you all agree ?
.@RiskAlert LOL so true " Tell Congress".#SuperSoulSunday
"Behind each person is  an utter mystery., supreme value ".  The more we recognize this the better we ALL get. #SuperSoulSunday
"Getting rid of our egos that's our task day in and out....little meanesses and pettiness " #SuperSoulSunday
"we can't afford to go on mistreating people.. We can't survive it " So true @KarenAnchorite  #SuperSoulSunday
Religion is supposed to be about the loss of the ego, not about its eternal survival. @KarenAnchorite #SuperSoulSunday
"I think the news should be a spiritual opportunity ".  So Agree with @KarenAnchorite This would change the world wouldn't it?
"If you just act compassionate all day and every day. You loose your fear" . So agree with that @KarenAnchorite  #SuperSoulSunday
If we could just know this ."every person in the world has pain and not give pain we don't wish to receive" #goldenrule #SuperSoulSunday
"That which is painful to you do not do to  your fellow man.  Look into  your own heart". @KarenAnchorite #SuperSoulSunday
#SuperSoulSunday so great today I'm watching again west coast. #SuperSoulSunday
Such good insight . Thank you @KarenAnchorite #SuperSoulSunday
"The main task of our time  is to build a global society-- where everyone gets mutual respect"  we need more of that thinking . agree?

Thanks @OWNCanada, canadian tweeters and all our Canadian supporters for joining us. #SuperSoulSunday

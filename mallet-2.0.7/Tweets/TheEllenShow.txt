I just texted Portia to come get me down from the cupboard. She was hiding in our closet waiting to scare me.
The housekeeper just left. I think Portia might be out. I have literally no idea how I'm gonna get out of here.
I can't believe Portia hasn't found me. Isn't she worried about where I am? After I scare the pants off her, we need to have a serious talk.
It's raspberry.
How could anyone get jam on a cupboard wall? That's disgusting. I wonder what flavor it is.
There's some jam on the wall of this cupboard. You know you've been hiding in a cupboard too long when wall jam starts to look good.
I just played Heads Up! with myself for an hour.
It wasn't Portia. It was one of the cats with a toy. Mystery solved.
I heard Portia come into the kitchen, but she didn't open the cupboard. She just shook a bell for 10 minutes and left. Strange.
You know in retrospect, there are a few things I wish I had done before I got in this cupboard. Nobody tweet about running water for awhile.
I can't get in the cupboard myself so asked the housekeeper to boost me. I wish I could say this is the weirdest thing I've asked her to do.
Portia was surprised I didn't try to scare her on Halloween. I'm gonna hide in the cupboard. Keep this tweet between the 23 million of us.

One of my favorite moments of the night was @CherLloyd coming out to sing 'Want U Back'. The crowd went insane!! And she's such a fun girl!
Tonight at Staples was an absolute DREAM. @SaraBareilles came out to sing 'Brave', one of my favorite songs. And she completely smashed it!!
Thank you for the sparkle, the screaming, the twinkle, the dreaming, and most of all the pep talk @taylorswift13. Your fans are amazing!
My picks for the two most talented pop stars under 40 (or 50?) just dueted, with @taylorswift13 bringing out @SaraBareilles for "Brave."

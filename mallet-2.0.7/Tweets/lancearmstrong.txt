Let me be clear: the riders in question are also victims of @usantidoping's unfair process and antics. #unconstitutional
Wishing your family strength, Krista. RIP, Kathleen. http://bit.ly/KRjXQO 
This isn't about @usantidoping wanting to clean up cycling - rather it's just plain ol' selective prosecution that reeks of vendetta.
...in exchange for immunity, anonymity, and the opportunity to continue to race the biggest event in cycling..
So let me get this straight...come in and tell  @usantidoping exactly what they wanted to hear...
Proof that I have had the honor to work with the best in the sport, @Sprintsalo, Eddie Reese, @dmswimmac all named to Olympic coaching staff
Congrats to the @LIVESTRONG #SurvivorSummit team - All 17 made it up Kilimanjaro today. http://bit.ly/MDcjxj

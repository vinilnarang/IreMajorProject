#TrollingSJSharksFans for fun and profit.
That said, absolutely amazing performance by Niemi tonight. Such a shame the Sharks will waste his talent in the playoffs, as usual.
Great playoff preview between the #LAKings and the Sharks... except for the part where the Sharks win, which never happens in the playoffs.

Thanks for all your kind comments about tonight’s #BigBangTheory. A special Vulcan salute to those of you who caught me doing The Riker.
I want Michelle Obama to be like, "Secret Service won't stop hovering around me, and I just want some space. #FirstLadyProblems"
And THAT, everybody, is the funniest scene I've ever been part of on television. Thanks, #BigBangTheory!

I kind of want to make "who the fuck is Wil Wheaton?" T-shirts, now. I bet I'd sell twos or even threes of them!
Don't tell @zdarsky, or it'll get weird. RT @stormkitten: @mattfraction @wilw I ship it.
Who the fuck is @wilw anyways?
David Koch provides jobs to over 60,000 Americans. How many jobs has @wilw created?
Yes, Google, this is correct. pic.twitter.com/Y2zKq9nA15

Oh no! Charles Koch’s wittle fee fees got all hurt by mean people. Maybe one of the politicians he owns can hold him until he feels better.

Phoenix's goalie is making some really huge saves tonight.
There is a beautiful crescent moon smiling down on us tonight.
NBCSports calls tonight’s hockey games “Wednesday Night Rivalry” but I really need them to call it “Wednesday Night Wivalry.”
For those of you who don’t know what my new show is, I direct you to my blog: http://is.gd/PciKqY 
Thank you to everyone who has been so kind to me today. It feels really good to know that I’m not the only one excited about my new show,
I was like, “Uncle Fukka is fine for your 7 year-old, but seeing gay characters is something you just can’t abide?” Then I was all “mmmkay.”
I saw South Park in the theatre at 1030pm on a week night. Parents of the year brought their child, & didn’t leave until the dildo appeared.
The fart solo in Uncle Fucka, though.
Welp, now I have to go listen to the entire South Park movie sound track.
Follow my plan and very soon you will say …. “it’s easy, mmmmkaaayyyy!”
Girl are you Ctrl+Alt+Del on a Mac? Cuz I'm hitting on you and literally nothing's happening.
The Roberts court wants to make it harder for people to vote, easier for ultra-rich to buy elections. This is a disaster for our country.
I was one outrageous dude, who was totally in their face.
I was totally half Joe Camel and a third Fonzarelli. #nailedit.
Also, Poochie should have access to a time machine.
"Oh yeah? Well you can cram it with walnuts, ugly!"
So I think I'm basically going to play this character like Poochie.
Well, I have a new promo picture. RT @MildlyAmused: @wilw This art was demanding to be made. I'm not even sorry. pic.twitter.com/b1KB1rht7Z
When you go to a voice over audition, find out that Tom Kenny went in before you for the same character, and wonder why you're even there.
I just found out that I’m doing another #BigBangTheory in a couple weeks! 

Everything’s coming up Wilhouse!
"The McCutcheon decision will inspire people to get rich so they can participate in the political process!"- some asshole.
"If you can't handle me at my worst, then you don't deserve me at my bees!"

When the Koch Brothers are thrilled about a Supreme Court ruling you know it must be good.
Lousy Smarch weather.
Updated my blog about The Wil Wheaton Project to answer some FAQs, if you’re interested: http://is.gd/PciKqY 
When you make a major announcement on your blog, then your blog shits the bed, and changes the URL to the post. Oops.
Announcing The Wil Wheaton Project http://is.gd/PciKqY 
In about 2 minutes, I’ll be publishing a blog post with everything about my new TV show. So, uh, get ready for that, I guess.
The Roberts Court won’t be happy until it just completely hands American Government over to the ultra rich and corporations, I guess.

I know this is a little silly, 
but because it’s a little chilly, 
for dinner, I’m making chili.
I guess Mr. T. took the day off from pitying people. Probably a good idea, because it would likely exhaust him today.
I bet Mr. T. is very busy pitying people today.
I talked to PASTE Magazine about @TableTopDay: http://is.gd/8OjAcG 
Err, three years. I forgot how to math.
Just in case I’m not the last to know, http://homestarrunner.com  has updated for the first time in four years! THIS IS NOT A JOKE THIS IS REAL!

I am completely overwhelmed by the kind and awesome messages I've gotten today from thousands of people. Thank you, and please be awesome.
I’ll tell you a secret: I don’t really like April Fools Day. 

Haha, April Fools! I LOVE IT. 

No but seriously it’s terrible.

Wonder if the cat from the "Hang in There" poster got crap from his peers for selling out
Imagine what would happen if you made an effort to be kind to every person you encountered today. Actually, don’t imagine it; do it.
I just read that @SELFmagazine made a meaningful and sincere apology: http://is.gd/r2Cit8 . Good on ya, SELF Magazine.
Me: Did you know I was trending yesterday? Nolan: Yeah, but so were Hot Wheels and Cheetos. Me: HAHAHAHA! Nolan: Sorry. Me: Perspective!
Wow. MT @LyssaPearl: Never EVER subscribing to @SELFmagazine. This is total BS ... http://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/Magazine-Makes-Fun-of-Cancer-Survivors-Tutu-252560451.html …

Absolutely gorgeous day in LA. If you're here, get outside and enjoy it!
Seriously, though, if all I’m remembered for is telling a little girl that it’s OK to be a nerd, and to be compassionate, I’m ok with that.
Um… I’m trending on Facebook? That’s … weird. I guess I should go be an asshole in public, or something.
Just finished The Last of Us. I must be camping, because that was ... in tents.

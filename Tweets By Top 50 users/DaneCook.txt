There are a lot of original new comedians working today.

Los Angeles. Laugh Factory. 10 tonight. Killer f’in show. 
Come play with me.
Anyone is capable of anything.

I love watching reruns of Cops from 20 years ago. 
The crimes are the same as today except the cops are wearing their throwback uniforms.

Tonight I gave my power to the Twitterverse and they were careless with it. Never again!!!!
Looks like I started a firestorm here. I’ve learned a lot. Haters make valuable points. @marcmaron likes wordplay & sitcom residuals suck.
The more haters you have the better you are.
Hosted SNL twice both to season high ratings. Everyone watching the repeat it’ll forever be 1 of the greatest things I’ve been apart of.
I love purposely pissing people off sometimes. 

It gives me mana!
Do you think, in outer space, a person admitting to their involvement in a homicide understands the gravity of the situation?
Yes, okay, I’m “very well endowed” but that doesn’t mean I don’t sometimes feel inferior and frightened by the world around me.

When I have sexual relations with a girl, I always turn off the dome light.
Girls with hair extensions never let you do it doggy style.
I'm headed to my friends going in party.
True love is when you sleep punch someone in the face and they don’t wake up and smack the shit outta you.

If your sunglasses have tinsel, fake gems or huge letters on them - congrats - youre a complete failure.
Forgiveness is overrated.
I don’t want the government telling me what I can or can’t do with my body.
I am high on life & the Lord’s my dealer. 
If I’m having a bad day I simply look at the sky & say, “Hey, you sold me some bad shit today.”
I dance and the world is at peace. 
I stop dancing and it’s a fuckbomb avalanche of hellish doomsday proportions.
Everyone's a hero in some way. 
Your way may be how, without a second thought, you run away from the opportunity to help someone in danger.
Hyperbole makes me want to lift up a continent and throw it at the moon.

Sometimes during sex I take a selfie.
When a high speed chase ends with someone pulling over and surrendering, that's like seeing a great movie with an awful ending.

Hey, if during sex the person you’re with shuts their eyes & blocks their ears, that’s like really sad.
A blowjob’s tough to enjoy when you’re in a high rise while a fire alarm’s going off & you think you smell smoke.

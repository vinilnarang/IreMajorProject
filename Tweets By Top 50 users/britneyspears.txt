What have you been listening to lately? #AskBritney
.@iTunesMusic Work Bitch is shaping up to be an incredible number in my Vegas residency. I think my fans are going to LOVE it. #AskBritney
What song from the album do you like to perform the most? #AskBritney
I dont think anyone ever thought they would see a @Tip feature on one of my albums :) #AskBritney
.@iTunesMusic The features may be surprising, but I'm really excited to have my sister @jamielynnspears & @Tip on the record... #AskBritney
Are there any surprises on Britney Jean? #AskBritney http://tw.itunes.com/6vW 
I tend to write from experience, but also enjoy fantasizing & writing from imagination. #AskBritney
I used this album to get out everything I'd bottled up over the last few years... #AskBritney
.@iTunesMusic On this album I mostly drew from personal experience. #BritneyJean was therapeutic... #AskBritney
Do you write songs from personal experience or from imagination? Or both? #AskBritney
.@iTunesMusic Of course! I've recorded a few songs in the past specifically about my boys and they are my daily inspiration. :) #AskBritney
Do your kids ever inspire your lyrics? #AskBritney
It also has a lot of personal songs. Songs that are very moody and vibe driven. #AskBritney
I typically make albums that are fun pop/dance records & #BritneyJean has a few, but... #AskBritney
.@iTunesMusic #BritneyJean is very special to me! It's a diff album than any other album I've recorded throughout my career... #AskBritney

Lots of love to everyone who has already gotten their copy of #BritneyJean :) MUAH! Xo http://smarturl.it/britneyjean?IQid=tw …
That's it!! Thx so much for listening through the album w/ me :) I love reading what u guys think of the songs! #BritneyJeanListeningParty
@britneyspears both :)
Which version of #Perfume do you guys like the best? I'm not sure I could choose!! I really love both :) #BritneyJeanListeningParty
Next Up: #NowThatIFoundYou! This song just sounds like love doesn't it? :) LOVE the music on this track! #BritneyJeanListeningParty
I think it helped set the direction for the album overall. RT @loosho @britneyspears what makes it different? #BritneyJeanListeningParty
It’s the 1st song I recorded for #BritneyJean. My dear friend @KooolKojak came over to my house w/ his guitar & we wrote this song together.
#HoldOnTight is a little different from the rest of the record, but I loved writing and recording this one!! #BritneyJeanListeningParty
@britneyspears my nephew who's 4 years old and has Autism.. My 'Brightest Morning Star' :) #BritneyJeanListeningParty
Brightest Morning Star is a song @Sia helped me write about God :) Who is ur Brightest Morning Star? #BritneyJeanListeningParty
He suggested getting Foster The People 2 help on production. I really think they nailed it. They added a few bells & the whistle on the song
When @iamwill & I were finishing the song we felt it was missing something. It felt like it needed something to make the song more unique...
Funny story about that! RT @EmreAkn I love the whistle in the beginning. It gives me chills. And the lyrics are soo emotional :(
This one was very therapeutic for me. Sometimes a girl needs to remind herself not to cry and that life will go on.
Really proud of the final version of #DontCry :) #BritneyJeanListeningParty
She's more of a country artist and I'm obviously pop so we figured we would meet in the middle :) #BritneyJeanListeningParty
She's been working on her first album in Nashville for a while and I thought it would be really cool to have her on my album.
.@jamielynnspears and I had SO much fun recording #ChillinWithYou!! #BritneyJeanListeningParty
I just loved this song and it spoke to me right away. RT @hausofbader The beat and lyrics are everything! #BritneyJeanListeningParty
My girl @KatyPerry wrote this one with @Sia and the @Diplo track is incredible :) #BritneyJeanListeningParty
I fell in love with #Passenger as soon as I heard it! #BritneyJeanListeningParty
Life is funny like that. Think I've kicked myself a few times after breaking up w someone. Dont kno why it’s always so clear AFTER u breakup
This makes me smile! RT @alekjandro it's makes me stronger, It's helping me@cope with a broken heart </3 #BritneyJeanListeningParty
#TilItsGone is a post-break up song, and it's true... You never really know what you have until it's gone. #BritneyJeanListeningParty
The show I'm putting together has more dance than any show I've ever done. I guess I was dancing until my body ached every single day. LOL!!
When I cut this song I was right in the middle of dance rehearsals for my Vegas show...
I think at my core, I am a dancer through and through. ;) #BritneyJeanListeningParty
And the next song is #BodyAche! I think this song speaks to my biggest passion which has always been dancing.
Seeing lots of these tweets! Hmmm.... RT @_DenverSean make #TikTikBoom a single. #BritneyJeanListeningParty
Next up: #TikTikBoom!! I knew immediately that I had to have @Tip on this track! You guys dig it? #BritneyJeanListeningParty
Always fun in the studio w @iamwill RT @GGsaid this song is so fun, you must have had a great time making it! #BritneyJeanListeningParty
Sometimes, we make love really complicated, but I've always felt It Should Be Easy :) #BritneyJeanListeningParty
So much love to @sia for helping create such an amazing song!! Xo #BritneyJeanListeningParty
Sooner than you think! RT @britneyspeans My favorite! when are we getting the video? #BritneyJeanListeningParty
Can you guess who this song is about?
#Perfume is really just about relationship insecurities & feeling insecure about the person you care for the most #BritneyJeanListeningParty
You better believe it! RT @dangerbritney Are u going to perform Work Bitch in Vegas? #BritneyJeanListeningParty
Here comes the smasher!! You betta #WorkBitch!! Confession: I do not have a Bugatti… yet ;) #BritneyJeanListeningParty
Such a massive fan. I def see myself working w him more in the future RT @StephanyValeIz #BritneyJeanListeningParty How was working w Orbit?
Sometimes I need to remind myself that i'm #NotAlone :) #BritneyJeanListeningParty
Song deals with loneliness and how you can be surrounded at all times by friends, family and adoring fans who you love and still feel alone.
Starting with Alien :) Loved working on this track with the very talented @WilliamOrbit! #BritneyJeanListeningParty

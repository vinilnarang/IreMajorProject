And yes, Holdman was author of SB 371, which required women to let an ultrasound camera take a picture inside their uterus.
Holdman says this is not 1st Amendment issue but a personal property rights issue. Says if someone doesn't have permission to video, can't.
Now Holdman is doing his bill that bars people from taking videos on farms and businesses if owners do not want them.
Senate passes bill targeting Lafayette clinic and requiring ultrasound for RU486 only. Vote is 33-16. Now goes to House.
That provision in SB 371 likely means Lafayette Planned Parenthood clinic would close. It dispenses abortion drug, but has no surgery.
SB 489 requires a clinic to hand out a consent form with color photographs. Stoops seeks amendment to require color photos for vasectomy.

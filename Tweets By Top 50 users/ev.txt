TIP: "There are some things we haven't told you" is a very compelling conversation starter. (And almost always true.)

It's a pleasant night for a walk.
Overheard at playground: "I'm not really a skeleton. It's just my Halloween costume."
So stoked by the @Twitter #hackweek demos. The future is bright.
Sez @rabble re Blue Bottle: "@ev It's average WITH credit card, most people are buying beans at that price, not lattes." Good point.
Wow, Blue Bottle Coffee Kiosk avg purchase price is $13.21? Guessing that's highly profitable. Rent must be low, too. http://data.mint.com/merchant/us/california/san-francisco/Blue+Bottle+Coffee+Kiosk …

Mr. Gladwell, I totally dig your hair but I respectfully disagree with your denigration of social media http://bit.ly/twitteractivism
I wrote more than 140 characters! It talks about what we're doing @OnTheRoad and is apparently called a "blog" "post". http://blog.twitter.com/2010/10/ontheroad.html …
☼ People of Twitter, when you auto-follow, you are helping the spammers hide under false endorsement. #SameAsItEverWas
It's hard to write about Twitter, because it requires looking at Twitter, leading to long tangents of exploration. Esp on a rainy Sunday.
This may just be the Evan Williams whiskey talking, but that's a fine damn Manhattan I made myself.
I get "Total Eclipse of the Heart" stuck in my head far too often -- from telling @miles to "turn around" to go down the stairs.

Done with #AskEv for today. By far, #1 question was when do I get #NewTwitter? Sorry I didn't get to more Q's. We'll do this again soon.
The account selection for #newTwitter is random and worldwide. #askev
The Big Q: When will you get #newTwitter? We're still only at small (but increasing!) % of people. Could be a few weeks for everyone. #askev
About to start answering questions: http://twitter.com/#!/twitter/status/24781991848 … #askev #newtwitter
